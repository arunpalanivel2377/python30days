# 🚀 30 Days of Python Confidence

Welcome to my **30-day journey** to master and gain true confidence in Python — by building real-world projects, solving daily coding challenges, and revisiting core concepts one step at a time.

> I already knew Python… but I wasn’t confident. This repo is my transformation log — from *"I kind of know it"* to *"I can build with it, solve with it, and teach it."*

## 📅 What’s in This Repo?

Each day has:
- ✅ 1 Python **project** (practical application)
- 🧠 1–2 Python **coding challenges**
- 🔁 Core **concept revision**
- 📁 Individual folder with:
  - `project.py`
  - `README.md`
  - Sometimes additional assets (e.g., data, files, APIs)
